First we have to install AWS CLI, so we can login to AWS with our credentials
    curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
    unzip awscliv2.zip
    sudo ./aws/install

terraform init > looks ate all the providers in your code and it'll download them to the local machine
	this command you create files in the directory
		.terraform/providers is where the providers who have been downloaded are located
			in adition if you've download terraform modules, this is where they're going to be installed
		.terraform.lock.hcl file is just a dependency lock file for caching
terraform plan > will look at the code, and it'll tell us want it's going to be created
terraform apply > runs the plan, and asks if we want to create this code
	it'll create the terraform.tfstate file, which is a JSON file, that specifies what's been created using the apply command
