# asterisk-k8s-aws
In this repository, I aim to construct a Kubernetes cluster housing Asterisk in containers on an AWS EC2 instance. Additionally, I plan to employ Terraform and Ansible for infrastructure provisioning and configuration. To further enhance the setup, I intend to utilize Python scripts alongside Asterisk's AGI (Asterisk Gateway Interface) for the configuration of Asterisk.
